            <h2>Hey there,<br>I'm Sarvesh since I was born!</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated computer science student and a creative learner. Some
                technologies I enjoy working with include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                I've also got a solid grip on programming languages like C, C++, and
                Java. Oh, and guess what? I'm currently learning to walk in the ML/DL
                realm without falling on my bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Connecting with like-minded individuals is my jam. If you share my
                excitement for Blockchain & Web3, enjoy bouncing around ideas, or are
                keen on uncovering exciting opportunities, I would love to connect
                with you. I'm totally up for diving into captivating and innovative
                projects together.
